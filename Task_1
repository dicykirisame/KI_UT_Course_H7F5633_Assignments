2a.  The study highlights that “specificity” (minimizing false positives) is as critical as sensitivity in spatial transcriptomics technologies. Non-specific signals, often due to molecule misassignment between neighboring cells, can lead to false conclusions in analyses (e.g., falsely attributing neuronal markers to astrocytes). This directly impacts disease research, such as misidentifying cell-type-specific dysregulation in neurological disorders or tumor microenvironments. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous benchmarking and computational corrections to ensure accurate biological insights, particularly in spatially complex tissues.
2b.  The study compared six imaging-based in situ spatial transcriptomics technologies.  For commercially available technologies:  1. Xenium 2. MERSCOPE and 3. Molecular Cartography.  For academic available technologies: 1.MERFISH  2. STARmap PLUS  and 3. EEL FISH.  Also, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (e.g., 10x Chromium, SMART-seq2) were used as references.
3a.  Extended Questions/Hypotheses:
How do these technologies perform in dynamic tissues when the RNA expression pattern and cell phenotypes change rapidly with time (e.g. small intestine surface with immune cells).
For scRNAseq, pseudo-temporal ordering analysis can be applied to analyze the dynamic change of individual cell types.  For spatial information it seems only a specific time can be captured for analysis, which may increase the false positive.  On the other hand, temporal variability in gene expression may exacerbate technical artifacts, mask true changes regarding to biological processes or diseases.
Moreover, for densely packed or morphologically complex tissues, such as tumors, how do these technologies perform in these kind of tissues?  Technologies with aggressive segmentation (10x, Xenium) may show higher false positives in dense tissue, while conservative methods (MERSCOPE) may lose sensitivity.
